<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

## ceaser cipher
- To keep your secret is wisdom; but to expect others to keep it is folly. 
- Let me assist you.
- I will help you encrypt it. 
- You only need to remember your cipher and your message is safe with me.

## Task:
    ```
    Replicate one of the oldest known encryption in code.

    Apply a Cesar cipher of 7 to the 'secret' variable.

    P.S.: http://www.montypython.net/scripts/dentist.php ;)

    You can start with the following code:

    
    secret = "I hear the gooseberries are doing well this year, and so are the mangoes."
    cipher = 7
